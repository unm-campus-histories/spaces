# Dummy Text :)
Here is some _very nice_ text showing off **all** of the cool things I can do for Fred Gibbs' [Digital History course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-history/schedule.html) using Markdown. 
* _Italicized text_  
  * very good for emphasis
* **bold** text
  * for strong feelings
  
* even image links ![kitty](https://data.junkee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/singingcat1.jpg) 


> Very important ideas belong in block quotes.

I didn't make this, but thank you Jessica I was able to learn the code from this :)

#### Conclusion  
Markdown is code and code isn't fun to learn.
