# Background

The McKinnon Center for Management is the staple of UNM’s northern edge of campus.  The multi-story building was constructed as a
replacement for the deteriorating Anderson School of Management building, and the $5 million funds were donated to UNM by Ian and Sonnet
McKinnon.  The building became accessible to students in the summer of 2018 after a year and a half of construction dating back to December
2016.  The building adjacent to MCM previously known as the Graduate School of Management has now assumed the Anderson School of Management
title.  Both buildings serve as the breeding grounds of success for all business students.
