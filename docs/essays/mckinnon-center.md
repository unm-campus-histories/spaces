# Background

The McKinnon Center for Management is the staple of UNM’s northern edge of campus.  The multi-story
building was constructed as a replacement for the deteriorating Anderson School of Management
building, and the $5 million funds were donated to UNM by Ian and Sonnet McKinnon.  The building 
became accessible to students in the summer of 2018 after a year and a half of construction dating back 
to December 2016.  The building adjacent to MCM previously known as the Graduate School of 
Management has now assumed the Anderson School of Management title.  Both buildings serve as the 
breeding grounds of success for all business students.

# Construction

Construction for the new management building began in December of 2016.  The plan was to demolish 
the current ASM building and erect the new one in its place rather than moving locations.  This portion 
of campus proved to be an area where student traffic was at a high and having to shut the area down 
for construction limited mobility and created multiple detours of common routes.  Buildings around this 
area included the Collaborative Teaching and Learning Building and the Economics building, as well as 
Hokona Hall.  The northern edge of campus was gated off and prevented students from accessing these 
buildings without seeking an alternate route.  These gates extended into campus as far as the CTLB.

# Side Effects

What was once a bustling area of students had now become a loud and distracting eyesore of a 
construction zone.  Students with classes in surrounding buildings were met with a displeasing view 
when they looked out the window, and the sounds generated from construction were often so loud that 
they forced professors to cancel class.  Nonetheless, crews worked long hours daily in order to complete 
the building as fast as possible, knowing that the constant disturbances were uncontrollable issues for 
the university.

Not only was the surrounding area affected by construction, but classes offered by ASM had to be 
moved to the Graduate School of Management building, where classrooms were limited, and professors 
had to adjust to their new classroom layouts.  In addition, the progression of construction led to new 
boundaries being formed. At one point, students were forced to walk through fences around the 
entirety of GSM just to get to their classrooms.
