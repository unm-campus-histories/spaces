# Background

The McKinnon Center for Management is the staple of UNM’s northern edge of campus.  The multi-story
building was constructed as a replacement for the deteriorating Anderson School of Management
building, and $5 million of the total $25.4 million funds were donated to UNM by Ian and Sonnet McKinnon.  The building
became accessible to students in the summer of 2018 after a year and a half of construction dating back
to December 2016.  The building adjacent to MCM previously known as the Graduate School of
Management has now assumed the Anderson School of Management title.  Together, these buildings make
up the school of business at UNM.

# Construction

Construction for the new management building began in December of 2016.  The plan was to demolish
the current west ASM building and erect the new one in its place rather than moving locations.  This portion
of campus proved to be an area where student traffic was at a high and having to shut the area down
for construction limited mobility and created multiple detours of common routes.  Buildings around this
area included the Collaborative Teaching and Learning Building and the Economics building, as well as
Hokona Hall.  The northern edge of campus was gated off and prevented students from accessing these
buildings without seeking an alternate route.  These gates extended into campus as far as the CTLB.

# Side Effects

What was once a bustling area of students had now become a loud and distracting eyesore of a
construction zone.  Students with classes in surrounding buildings were met with a displeasing view
when they looked out the window, and the sounds generated from construction were often so loud that
they forced professors to cancel class.  Nonetheless, crews worked long hours daily in order to complete
the building as fast as possible, knowing that the constant disturbances were uncontrollable issues for
the university.

Not only was the surrounding area affected by construction, but classes offered by ASM had to be
moved to both the Graduate School of Management building and the east ASM building, where classrooms were limited
and professors had to adjust to their new classroom layouts.  In addition, the progression of construction led to new
boundaries being formed. At one point, students were forced to walk through fences around the
entirety of the east ASM building just to get to their classrooms.

# Completion

Much to the joy of professors and students alike, the construction of the McKinnon Center for
Management was completed on March 15, 2018.  The building would undergo further tests to make
sure it was safe and secure.  By May 11, the MCM was officially open.  The grounds around the building
were littered with benches, rock beds, and grassy patches, and the design of the building itself made it stand out
well above the others in surrounding.  The building is easily noticeable when standing on the street just north of it,
as it is the largest and cleanest building on UNM's northern campus.

# MCM Today

After not even a year of being accessible to students at the time that this was written, the McKinnon
Center for Management has already proved itself to be one of the most prominent buildings featured on
UNM’s campus, as well as the most modern.  The building also came with a new student drop-off zone,
which only makes the area more easily accessible.  MCM is forecasted to last about 50 years, and in that
time it will continue to house an innovative business culture for students and staff.
