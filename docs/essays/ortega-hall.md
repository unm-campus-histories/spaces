### Location
Ortega Hall is located southwest of Zimmermann Library and east of the Smith Plaza. 

### History of the Grounds
The current location of Ortega Hall has been a busy area prior to the construction that created the hall. This area was first occupied by Zimmerman Stadium which had opened in 1938 and could hold 16,000 spectators for sporting events. The stadium was occupied by intramural sports after the Lobo Football team had moved to what is now DreamStyle Stadium. After the demolition of Zimmerman Stadium the University decided to rebuild on this area which is now occupied by Ortega Hall, Woodward Hall, and the Humanities Building. 


### Construction of Oretga Hall 
 

### The Exterior Design
This 50,000 square foot classroom and faculty office building at the University of New Mexico also contains clusters of language labratories and audiovisual rooms as well as a large student lounge and library. Completed in 1977 for a cost of $1,440,000, this first increment in the main academic area of the central campus established the upper pedestrian walkway system which connects the major academic buildings south of the central plaza.  

### The Interior Design and Classrooms

### Naming the Building
The decision of the building was difficult for those involved but they had come by with a decision to honor Joaquin Ortega. Joaquin Ortega taught at a multitude of different universities across the United States. At New Mexico he was know for being a Spanish Professor, the Director of the School of Inter-American Affairs and Editor of The New Mexico Quarterly. Professor Ortega inspired students daily and left an impact of every student he encountered. Professor Ortega passed away in Rondo, Spain August 25, 1955. In memory of his passing the University named this new building after him and designated it for the study of Foreign Languages.
