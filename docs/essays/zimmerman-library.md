The inspiration and mastermind architect behind the creation of Zimmerman Library goes by the name of John Gaw Meem. Born in Brazil, Meem originally migrated to New York. After being diagnosed with tuberculosis, John Meem moved to a dryer climate. Eventually landing himself in Santa Fe from the attraction of the Santa Fe railroad. This is where his love for the architectural style of New Mexico was born. Meems first projects consisted of renovating adobe roofs on churches throughout the Pueblos of New Mexico. Thus helped improve Meems craft of building the unique style of adobe found in the southwest.

## The Creation

In the year 1929, one of the University of New Mexico's late presidents, James Zimmerman applied for federal money through the New deal. After receiving the financial help, the main plan was to build a core of buildings for the expanding university. President Zimmerman wanted the style of the new buildings to follow along with the culture of the adobe housing in New Mexico. John Meem, who was gaining a lot of attention through his southwest architectural style was the right man for the job. Meem was hired to commission multiple buildings on UNMs main campus. The building most famous from John Meems commissions was Zimmerman Library. [^source1]

## The Layout

Zimmerman Library was built with the Spanish Pueblo style of architecture. The library was erected on the unfinished part of the university. Currently Zimmerman Library sits right in the middle of campus almost celebrating the great build by the southwest architectural builder. The main building stands two stories high. With wings running north, south, east, and west. The exterior steel, concrete brick, and buttressing corners had resemblance of the mission churches. Where Meem first received experience to the southwestern architectural style. The interior of Zimmerman Library was completed by local craftsman around Albuquerque. This entailed anywhere from the murals inside, intricate wood carvings, and handmade furniture. All of these tiny details were in attempt to keep this new building as close to the New Mexican culture as possible.

## Spatial Space

At the time of Zimmerman libraries creation, President Zimmerman wanted to preserve the culture of New Mexico. Making all the buildings adobe style created a very unique environment for the university. Being one of the first buildings put up on campus helped pave the way on how future buildings would be built. John Meems also built the library big enough to fill the needs of all the students. Not making the library too big right away helped allow for renovations through out the years. This was so Zimmerman Library could grow with the university in it's pre existing space. This philosophical building style can be attributed to how pueblo buildings are upgraded according to the occupants of that space. Which came from meems days of renovating Pueblo churches. Not only is the building style with in the New Mexican culture, but also the ideology of upgrading and making a bigger library for the students of the university. Making every aspect of the building associated with President Zimmerman’s one goal.

## Current Day Zimmerman

The area around Zimmerman was once a empty space. Now it's the main attraction on campus. Located right by the big court yard, its a perfect place for Meem to have envisioned what was to come for this great campus. Unfortunately, the view of the mountains are no longer visible. As the university grew so did the number of buildings on campus. Even in the year 2017, brand new modern buildings are still keeping to New Mexico's style of adobe buildings. From Zimmerman Libraries humble beginnings to now, there has been a significant amount of upgrades to this historical building. There are three floors with a basement as well. The first floor is where the most foot traffic occurs. Also including a Starbucks making the library very modern. The next two floors above are where most of the book cases are located. Along with different offices for student help and service. The basement is where a lot of the important documentation is located. Ranging any were from government documents to past dissertations. All of these extra elements is exactly what John Meem wanted for a ever expanding university.

## Closing Statement

President James Zimmerman and architect John Meem would be very pleased to find out that the university still values their visions. From 1938 till now the University of New Mexico strives to keep the culture of New Mexico alive and well on campus. Upgrading buildings when needed and using the adobe style to preserve that vision. The fact that Zimmerman Library was built in the 30s and is still going strong today 70 odd years later is all John Meem could've asked for. Essentially using Zimmerman library as a time capsule to celebrate the visions of great people and the culture of New Mexico.
