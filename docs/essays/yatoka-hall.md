# Yatoka Hall

Yatoka Hall has a very interesting history as part of the UNM campus, mainly because nobody remembers that it exists. The space that once belonged to Yatoka Hall is now significantly overshadowed by this space's current use, the [Duck Pond](https://unm-campus-histories.github.io/spaces/essays/quintana-duck-pond).
