# Background

Dane Smith Hall is a 89,000-square-foot, multipurpose classroom building built in the heart of campus to meet the Universitiy's rapidly growing demand for genral education meeting rooms. It was the first general education classroom built at UNM since 1950, making the need for this building neccesary at its time of construction.

# Construction

Initial plans for Dane Smith Hall began in 1996, when the board of regents at UNM voted to begin building a new multipurpose classroom to help compensate the large volume of students attending the university. The building was designed by PA Architects, a local company out of Albuquerque. Construction was delayed multiple times due to arguments over the cost of the new building and relocations of the patrons living on the land that hosted Dane Smith before it came to be.

Before becoming home to one of the most widely used buildings on campus, the land hosting Dane Smith Hall was home to a small neighborhood. Within this neighborhood lived various professors at UNM. Dane Farnsworth Smith, the namesake of Dane Smith Hall, lived in a small house with his wife in this neighborhood. He is one of many professors from this small neighborhood to have a building on campusnamed after him. These professors include Coach Johnson (Johnson Gym), Professor Clark (Clark hall), and Stuart Northrop (Northrop Hall).
