Where is the heart of the University of New Mexico? Some might say the stylistically striking Zimmerman Library or the ever-bustling Student Union Building—not a tucked-away science building on the edge of campus. But if the university has a historical heart, it lies in the Anthropology building. Shielded by massive pines on the western side of campus, this squat complex contains a lecture hall, labs, offices, and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. Though it has a low profile today, it was once the center of campus life as the original Student Union Building.

## Construction

The 1930s marked one of several bursts of construction for the university thanks to increased enrollment and funds provided by the Works Progress Administration. The needs of the student body called for the construction of a Student Union, and the university tapped John Gaw Meem to design the building. One of the four original buildings designed by Meem (the others being Zimmerman Library, Scholes Hall, and Bandelier Hall), the Anthropology building remains an example of the Pueblo Revival style the university is known for. Construction on the Student Union began in 1936. In 1937, an open house followed the dedication of the building, and students broke in their new ballroom with a dance.[^hooker]

In the 1950s, rising enrollment strained the resources of the diminutive Student Union. Construction of a newer, larger building began in 1959, which would become the Student Union Building we know today, and the ‘old SUB’ was refitted for the purposes of the Anthropology Department. The transition required a number of interior renovations, including the addition of the Anthropology Annex (faculty offices and labs) and space for the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. The Anthropology Department moved in to its current home from the Administrative Building (now Scholes Hall) in 1960.[^csw]

## Renovations

The 1970s marked a decade of construction, renovation, and frustration for the Anthropology Department. The university experienced a seating crisis as it struggled to match classes to appropriately-sized classrooms. In 1970, funds from the National Science Foundation spurred renovation of the Anthropology Annex, which created more room for the Maxwell Museum and anthropological research. By 1979, more renovations to the annex were already being discussed as a part of the university’s attempts to resolve their seating issues.[^csw-2]

While the university’s larger problem of class sizes had little to do with the Anthropology building, a prominent aspect of the building's past drove renovations. When the Student Union moved out and the Anthropology Department moved in, the old ballroom became a massive lecture hall. Correspondence between university officials reveal frustrations with this space: the acoustics and spaciousness of the former SUB ballroom made it almost unusable for lecturers, problems further exacerbated by an excess of seats versus class sizes (475 seats vs. 200 students); and poor technical equipment and lighting made it difficult to use for film classes, which are normally better suited to large rooms. Many letters between instructors, administrators, and architects reveal that the process of planning and approving renovations was a slow one, finally reaching completion in 1982. [^csw-3]

## Anthropology, Today

Once the bustling heart of campus life, today the Anthropology building is easy to overlook. It's location on the far edge of campus means most students won't pass by the building on a daily basis, much less step inside; the veritable orchard outside the main entrance even makes it difficult to photograph. Although, as a science building, we might consider it specialized and secondary to buildings like Zimmerman Library or the Humanities building which occupy much more of our day-to-day life as students, this little rectangle was the heart of the University of New Mexico for other generations.

When the Student Union moved east, the whole campus shifted with it, but fragments of the Anthropology building's past remain. The signature ballroom acoustics still cause an echo in the building's main corridor, an indication that the building was meant to accomdate a crowd. Across the many interior and exterior changes it has endured, the building maintains John Gaw Meem's original architectural vision. In these ways the Anthropology Building still *is* the heart of the University of New Mexico: the steadily-beating reminder of the university's past, even as it moves into the future.
