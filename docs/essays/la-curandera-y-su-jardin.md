## Intro
This is a website dedicated to the structure known as "La Curandera y su Jardin". The name translates to "The Medicine Woman and her Garden". The Sculpture was made by Reynaldo Rivera, and made of bronze.[^source1] The sculpture is prominent to New Mexicans as it pays Homage to the book "Bless Me Ultima". It is located in Albuquerque's Botanical Garden. The history of Curanderas in New Mexico goes back 300 years and thus it is a very important part of New Mexican history.[^source4] The Curanderas use herbs to heal their patients, in a from that may be compared to Witchcraft.

To understand the artpiece more, the term "Curandera" has to be fully understood. Curandera, or Medicine Woman in English is a term to describe a Native American or Hispanic healer, who uses different herbs or plants to heal their patients. A curandera may also be called a healer, or a folk doctor. Curanderas or Curanderos have a long and rich history in New Mexico. New Mexico even has natural healing schools who use plants of the Southwest for their traditioanl uses. It is also known as Herbology.

The inspiration for the sculpture comes from the book "Bless Me, Ultima". The book is based on a Curandera, just like in the sculpture, she is asked for spiritual help. Curanderas are only available through "word-of-mouth". This is what happens in the book. When the book was adapted into a film, it was filmed entirely in New Mexico.

  The Botanical Garden showcases mostly New Mexico plants such as yucca, agave, cholla, fairy duster, and apache plus, with some Mediterranean plants as well. These plants, native to New Mexico, are among the most popular plants used by the Curanderas.[^source2] The Structure which is in the Botonical Garden was revealed only two years after the Botanical Garden opened. The Garden is opened year round, so the Sculpture is always available, and the plants grow year round. The sculpture happens to be one of the biggest in the Botonical Garden, which is 36 acres. [^source3] It is situated in the Medicinal Herb display. These are the herbs Curanderas use for their work. Curanderas continue to grow such Medicinal herbs in their own extensive gardens for their spiritual healing and for food. Modern day curanderas use their herbs for everyday lives for themselves and their families, including their children.[^source5] The sculpture was placed here for this reason. Being located in the Botanical Garden, only those who visit the Botanical Garden will be able to see it. Although it represents a big part of New Mexico's history, it focuses on the Herbal history. Inside the Botanical Garden that history is represented with all the herbs. The structure is a celebration of plants with healing capabilities.

  The structure is so big, and being a statue, it will be easy to spot, and also know that you are looking at a piece of art. The Botanical Garden is a representation of New Mexico herbs. Herbs have been an important part of New Mexico for centuries, as some historians would suggest. This structure gives visitors a feel for what New Mexico's history with herbs is like. From the herbs, the Curanderas recieve their living. The Botanical Garden does not dedicate itslef to Curanderas, but to the herbs. The structure will let visitors from other states know that the herbs in display are much more important to New Mexico's culture. With Curanderas being a big part of New Mexico's history, the Structure depicts an important part of New Mexico. The Medicinal Herb Display is the perfect location for the Sculpture. The herbs found feet away are the same herbs used by those Curanderas, who are a major part of New Mexico.
