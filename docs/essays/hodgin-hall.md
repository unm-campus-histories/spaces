If you aren’t familiar with the University Building and do not know where it is located, you are not alone. This University Building has had four name changes and is currently called Hodgin Hall, Alumni Center. This building is located off the corner of Central and University, previously railyard road, and is the heart and backbone of UNM. Some would say it is the unexplored heart, but we will get into that later. Hodgin Hall is where it all started. That’s correct, it is the very first building that was constructed on UNM’s campus and was the only building for almost a decade.

A lonely site west of the Sandia Mountains laid twenty acres of land that were generously donated for the future campus.  Amongst rocky soil and fields of chamiso laid the ground where the UNM’s first building was sought out to be built. The University building was completed in 1892 after the Territorial Act in 1889. This building was the sole location for the Preparatory and Normal School, severing one hundred and eight students in fall of 1892.
