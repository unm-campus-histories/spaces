In an architectural sense, UNM has furiously sought after to reflect itself within the space in which it surrounds. La Posada Dining Hall, Laguna and De Vargas Dormitory, and all other building that came before and after all have displayed that UNM wants to represent its unique modern South Western cultere in its architecture. La Posadas, architecturally being built in an adobie style, reflectings UNMs latter 20th century culture, similar to other building built at the time like the Laguna Dormitory, De Vargas Dormitory, Kiva Lecture Hall, and the Farris Engineering Center.

### Planned Construction

During the consideration of whether or not La Posada Dinning Hall would be built by the Universtity of New Mexico Board of Regents in 1966, other buildings including the Farris Engineering Center, a the dorm which would be later known as Laguna Dormitory, and De Vargas Dormitory were also proposed. This proposal was in direct response to counter another proposal for a high-rise dormatory complex.These dormatories and dinning hall all being later approved for construction in 1966 by the UNM Board of Regents. After a series of bids, the UNM board of Regents contracted Lembke Construction Company to build what would be La Posada Dining Hall.
